# Using Network Analysis and Natural Language Processing to help you understand the US Congress.

With the 2020 US election being close to finished, we once again find ourselves at the end of a long period of time where US politics has been on everyones lips. But for us Danes, the US political system can seem.. well, quite chaotic? In the light of the recent election, a term you might have heard come across is the United States Congress. Curious to know more about the US Congress? Well look no further!


In this project, we will be studying data from the **US Congress**, and how it has changed over the past 13 years. More specifically, we will be asking ourselves questions like: 
- Is there chaos in congress? 
- Does polarization exist, and to what degree do the members agree with each other â€“ and what do they agree on? 
- How does this look internally in each party, and between the parties as well? 
- We would perhaps assume that we can put the two parties into two distinct boxes, but is this really true? 
- And has this changed over time?
