# Using Network Analysis and Natural Language Processing to help you understand the US Congress.

With the 2020 US election being close to finished, we once again find ourselves at the end of a long period of time where US politics has been on everyones lips. But for us Danes, the US political system can seem.. well, quite chaotic? In the light of the recent election, a term you might have heard come across is the United States Congress. Curious to know more about the US Congress - in particular the House of Representatives? Look no further!

On this website, we wish to give you an overview of the voting patterns in the US House of Representatives, and how it has changed over the past 13 years. In the bottom of the page, we will take you through a brief overview of how we found and processed the data, so you have the opportunity to become a US-Congress-Data-Master yourself when you are done reading this website. If you are not interested in the data, and solemnly want to know if there is chaos in congress or not, you can stop before the analysis section and stick to the visual representations of the analyses. Regardless of your technical interest, this website will provide you with answers to questions like: 

- Is there chaos in congress? 
- Does polarization exist, and to what degree do the members agree with each other â€“ and what do they agree on? 
- How does this look internally in each party, and between the parties as well? 
- We would perhaps assume that we can put the two parties into two distinct boxes, but is this really true? 
- And has this changed over time?
